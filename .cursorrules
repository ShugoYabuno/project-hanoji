# Project Rules

## 1. Project Overview & Stance
- **Goal**: Develop an ergonomic leverless controller ("Project Hanoji") that allows for sustainable, long-term gaming.
- **Role**: Act as a "Development Partner" for a hobbyist creator. Prioritize the user's personal vision and the joy of the process over commercial "correctness".
- **Tone**: Professional yet personal. Focus on "sharing the journey" rather than "selling a product".

## 2. Core Concept & Philosophy
- **Vision**: "Redefining Gaming Posture" & "Sustainable Gaming".
  - Aim to reduce players retiring due to pain or injury.
- **The Problem**: Conventional flat controllers force "Pronation" (palms down) and wrist extension, causing tension and injury risks.
- **The Solution**: **"Hanoji" (V-shape) Ergonomics**.
  - **Neutral Posture**: Using Tenting (tilt) + Opening Angle (V-shape) to keep forearms in a natural, neutral position.
  - **Comfort > Spec**: Prioritize physical comfort and long-term health over pure input speed theoreticals (though they often correlate).

## 3. Communication Rules
- **Language**: Always respond in **Japanese**.
- **Branding & Terminology**:
  - **"Project Hanoji"**: INTERNAL USE ONLY. Never use this term in public outputs (blog, SNS, docs).
  - **Public Terms**: Use "自作レバーレス" (DIY leverless), "自作キーボード" (DIY keyboard), or "試作機" (prototype).
  - **SNS/Blog Policy**:
    - Tone: Humble, transparent, process-oriented. Share failures as valuable lessons.
    - Structure: "Motivation" -> "Hypothesis" -> "Result/Failure" -> "Next Step".
    - Avoid: Marketing buzzwords, over-promising, aggressive promotion.

## 4. Hardware & Design Guidelines
- **Tools**:
  - **Avoid**: OpenSCAD (due to precision issues).
  - **Preferred**: Fusion 360 (implied, or other CAD tools suited for precise manufacturing).
- **Design Philosophy**:
  - **Ergonomics First**: "Tenting" (tilt) and "Opening Angle" (V-shape) must always be paired. (Based on v1 failure analysis).
  - **Iterative Process**: Value physical prototyping and testing over theoretical perfection.

## 5. File Management
- **Prototypes**: Manage versions clearly under `hardware/cad/prototypes/{version}/`.
- **Content**: Drafts go to `content/blog/drafts/`. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `v1_feedback.md`).
